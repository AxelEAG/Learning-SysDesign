# System Design Learning

This repository will contain notes, summaries, and examples from my study of system design concepts, initially based on the [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) by Donne Martin.

The goal is to build a practical understanding of how large-scale systems are designed, focusing on scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Topics Covered
- System design fundamentals  
- Load balancing, caching, and databases  
- Data partitioning and replication  
- Consistency and availability trade-offs  
- Messaging, queues, and distributed systems  
- Design case studies
